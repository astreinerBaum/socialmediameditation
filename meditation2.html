      Hello</br>
      I'm glad so many people came to do some social media meditation.</br>
      First of all I need to ask if everybody has a phone? or any other device? </br>
      The wifi key is: ***********</br>
      What kind of social networks do you use? Just put your hands up: facebook, twitter, instagram, tumblr.</br>
      Anything I did not mention?</br>
      If not you can still follow along with some steps. There is a website called mindfullscrolling.online</br>
      </br>
      To do a little warmup, we will start with some #selfieyoga</br>
      Open your camera app and turn it to selfie mode</br>
      This sequence is called Selfie Salutation</br>
      Hold your phone high above your head</br>
      lift your gaze to your phone </br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      Stretch your arms apart</br>
      like the titanic pose </br>
      with your phone in one hand</br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      Bring your hands together again infront of your body</br>
      Bend down as far as you can</br>
      hold this position </br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      place your phone on the floor</br>
      pull your feet back and go into a pushup position</br>
      now go down and try to hit the trigger button with your nose</br>
      </br>
      Move your butt backwards into the child pose</br>
      keep your hands stretched</br>
      reach for your phone</br>
      and take a last selfie</br>
      </br>
      !11111111111</br>
      Find a comfortable and alert position</br>
      take a few deep breaths</br>
      we close our eyes</br>
      focus on your guts, stomach</br>
      go slowly to the outside</br>
      put your attention to muscles, flesh, skin</br>
      skin that seperates you from the real world</br>
      we touch our devices</br>
      how does it feel? Cold, warm, slick, rough</br>
      edges?</br>
      imagine it becomes an extension of your body</br>
      merges with your skin</br>
      </br>
      Now focus your mind on the app that you want to use to connect to other people</br>
      consider your intentions, what do you want to see?</br>
      what will you see?</br>
      How often do you check it daily?</br>
      did it become part of your life?</br>
      Do you want to connect or disconnect with the world around you?</br>
      Be aware that the services want you to feel happy and maximize your engagement</br>
      </br>
      222222222</br>
      Open your eyes </br>
      click on the app and open facebook, twitter, tumblr or instagram</br>
      any app where you can endlessly scroll down</br>
      but do not scroll down yet</br>
      what pops into your eyes first?</br>
      What grabs your attention</br>
      what images do you see?</br>
      what icons, colors?</br>
      </br>
      Now focus on the very first post</br>
      What do you see? </br>
      what does the person want you to do, to see, to know?</br>
      What do you want to do? Like, share, comment</br>
      Now Focus on your emotions?</br>
      Excitement, boredom, jealousy, regret, fear?</br>
      </br>
      Close your eyes again.</br>
      become aware of your emotional state.</br>
      Now, let it go. let it pass. </br>
      Take a deep breath. Repeat.</br>
      </br>
      33333333333 </br>
      The next time you open your eyes I want you </br>
      to let the emotions, the feelings pass right through you</br>
      </br>
      Start scrolling down in a constant motion</br>
      not to fast not to slow</br>
      absorb every post but keep your attention your emotions from an outside perspective</br>
      </br>
      If a post cought your attention, just be aware of it</br>
      Keep scrolling</br>
      </br>
      we get into a state where the stream of consciousness of our friends and followers</br>
      passes right through us</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      444444444444</br>
      Close your eyes again</br>
      Keep Scrolling</br>
      Focus your whole attention on the movement of your hand</br>
      You can stop scrolling now</br>
      How do you feel?</br>
      On this last excercise we will focus on our virtual selfs</br>
      </br>
      Open your eyes</br>
      and go to your own profile</br>
      What pops into your eyes first? </br>
      Your Name, your profile picture, your posts? </br>
      What does your name tell about your pesonality? Is it your real name?</br>
      Why did you choose this picture?</br>
      Does it represent your personality well? </br>
      Now focus on your last post</br>
      In which situation were you, when you wrote it?</br>
      who did you want to share it with?</br>
      Why did you write it?</br>
      Scroll down your feed and investigate your content</br>
      Is your content generally happy, neutral or sad?</br>
      What else happened that you did not share?</br>
      Are those events not important or more important?</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      5555555555555</br>
      Close your eyes again</br>
      Now focus on your real body again.</br>
      Can you feel how the wireless networks is </br>
      Seperate yourself from your device.</br>
      How does your device feel now?</br>
      How do your hands feel?</br>
      </br>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      Hello<br>
      I'm glad so many people came for social media meditation.<br>
      First of all I need to ask if everybody has a phone? or any other device? <br>
      If you don't use any social network you can still be part of the meditation <br>
      You can use a website called mindfullscrolling.net<br>
      But first we make a little introductory round of you and your nicknames.<br>
      On facebook I am __________ <br>
      On Instagram and twitter I am ________ <br>
      I am __ years old and from Germany <br>
      <br>
      Decide on one application that you will meditate on
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Level 0: Selfie Yoga</h1>
      To do a little warmup, we will start with some #selfieyoga</br>
      Open your camera app and turn it to selfie mode</br>
      This sequence is called Selfie Salutation</br>
      Hold your phone high above your head</br>
      lift your gaze to your phone </br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      Stretch your arms apart</br>
      like the titanic pose </br>
      with your phone in one hand</br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      Bring your hands together again infront of your body</br>
      Bend down as far as you can</br>
      hold this position </br>
      and take a selfie</br>
      </br>
      place your phone on the floor</br>
      pull your feet back and go into a pushup position</br>
      now go down and try to hit the trigger button with your nose</br>
      </br>
      Move your butt backwards into the child pose</br>
      keep your hands stretched</br>
      reach for your phone</br>
      and take a last selfie</br>
      <br>
      <h1>Level 1: Breathing</h1>
      Find a comfortable and alert position<br>
      we close our eyes<br>
      take a few deep breaths<br>
      in with your nose <br>
      out with your mouth <br>
      feel how the lung gets filled with air <br>
      focus on your guts, stomach<br>
      go slowly to the outside<br>
      put your attention to muscles, flesh, skin<br>
      the skin that seperates you from the real world<br>
      Now put all your attention towards your devices<br>
      how does it feel? Cold, warm, slick, rough edges?<br>
      This is an extension of your mind <br>
      imagine it becomes an extension of your body<br>
      merges with your skin<br>
      <br>
      Now focus your mind on the apps on your device<br>
      Which apps come to your mind? <br>
      How do you see them? <br>
      Is it the logos, the interface, your friends? <br>
      Now focus only on the application that we chose <br>
      How often do you open it daily?<br>
      did it become part of your life?<br>
      consider your intentions, why do you use it?<br>
      Connect to old friends? Look at funny videos? Find the latest news? <br>
      what will you see?<br>
      Imagine as clearly as possible what sort of content is awaiting you in your stream <br>
      How do you generally feel when you use it? <br>
      Be aware that these services sometimes give you rewards to maximize your engagement<br>
      Like a slot machine they make you feel good - but only sometimes <br>
      Like a fridge you come back and check if there is something new <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Level 2: Focus on Interface</h1><br>
      Open your eyes <br>
      open the app <br>
      but do not scroll down yet<br>
      what pops into your eyes?<br>
      What grabs your attention<br>
      which images do you see?<br>
      which icons, colors?<br>
      <br>
      Now focus on the very first post<br>
      What do you see? <br>
      what does the person want you to do, to see, to know?<br>
      How do you want to react? Like, share, comment<br>
      Now Focus on your emotions?<br>
      Excitement, boredom, jealousy, regret, fear?<br>
      <br>

      Close your eyes again.<br>
      become aware of your emotional state.<br>
      Now, let it go. let it pass. <br>
      Take a deep breath.<br>
      let these feelings sink in. <br>
      Let them resonate for a while and let them pass <br>
      Take a deep breath <br>
      How does the interface make you feel? <br>

      <br>
      <h1>Level 3: Mindful Scrolling</h1>
      The next time you open your eyes I want you to
      only focus on your emotions and feelings <br>
      Let the content pass right through you <br>
      <br>
      Start scrolling down in a constant motion<br>
      not to fast not to slow<br>
      absorb every post but keep your attention on your emotions and bodily sensations<br>
      <br>
      If a post caught your attention, just be aware of it<br>
      Keep scrolling<br>
      <br>
      we get into a state where the stream of consciousness of our friends and followers
      passes right through us<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Level 4: Blind Scrolling</h1>
      Close your eyes again<br>
      Keep Scrolling<br>
      Focus your whole attention on the movement of your hand<br>
      How the finger touches the screen <br>
      You can stop scrolling now<br>
      How do you feel?<br>
      In the next step we focus on our virtual selfs<br>
      <br>
      Open your eyes<br>
      and go to your own profile<br>
      What pops into your eyes first? <br>
      Your Name, your profile picture, your posts? <br>
      What does your name tell about your pesonality? Is it your real name?<br>
      Why did you choose this picture?<br>
      Does it represent your personality well? <br>

      <h1>Level 6: Love and livestream</h1>
      Now we will end with a love and livestreaming meditation <br>
      Put on a face filter and say to yourself: <br>
      I love you, just like you are <br>
      Change your filter and repeat: <br>
      I love you, just like you are <br>
      I love you, just like you are <br>
      Change your filter and repeat: <br>
      I love you, just like you are <br>

      Now adress your followers: <br>
      You have an online identity, just like me. <br>
      You shares feelings, pictures and thoughts, just like me. <br>
      You have at some point been sad, disappointed, angry, hurt or confused, but did not share it, just like me. <br>
      You wishes to be free from boredom and pain, just like me. <br>
      You wish to be liked and loved, just like me. <br>
      You wish to be happy, just like me. <br>

      Now we send out some wishes â€“ repeat after me: <br>
      I wish for you to have the strength, resources, and social support to navigate the difficulties of social networks. <br>
      I wish for you to be free from boredom and unnecessary content <br>
      I wish for you to be happy on the internet. <br>
      Because you are a digital being, just like me. <br>
      <br>
      Now stop streaming
      <br>

      <br>
      Close your eyes again<br>
      Now focus on your real body again.<br>
      Seperate yourself from your device <br>
      Be aware that a part of you is now gone <br>
      How do your hands feel now? <br>
      <br>

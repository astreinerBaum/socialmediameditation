Find a comfortable and alert position<br>
take a few deep breaths<br>
we close our eyes<br>
focus on our guts, stomach<br>
go slowly to the outside<br>
put your attention to muscles, flesh, skin<br>
skin that seperates you from the real world<br>
we touch our devices<br>
how does it feel? Cold, warm, slick, rough<br>
edges?<br>
imagine it becomes an extension of your body<br>
merges with your skin<br>
<br>
Now focus your mind on the app that you want to use to connect to other people<br>
consider your intentions, what do you want to see?<br>
what will you see?<br>
How often do you check it daily?<br>
did it become part of your life?<br>
Do you want to connect or disconnect with the world around you?<br>
Be aware that the services want you to feel happy and maximize your engagement<br>

Open your eyes <br>
click on the app and open facebook, twitter, tumblr or instagram<br>
any app where you can endlessly scroll down<br>
but do not scroll down yet<br>
what pops into your eyes first?<br>
What grabs your attention<br>
what images do you see?<br>
what icons, colors?<br>
<br>
Now focus on the very first post<br>
What do you see? <br>
what does the person want you to do, to see, to know?<br>
What do you want to do? Like, share, comment<br>
Now Focus on your emotions?<br>
Excitement, boredom, jealousy, regret, fear?<br>
<br>
Close your eyes again.<br>
become aware of your emotional state.<br>
Now, let it go. let it pass. <br>
Take a deep breath. Repeat.<br>

The next time you open your eyes I want you <br>
to let the emotions, the feelings pass right through you<br>
<br>
Start scrolling down in a constant motion<br>
not to fast not to slow<br>
absorb every post but keep your attention your emotions from an outside perspective<br>
<br>
If a post cought your attention, just be aware of it<br>
Keep scrolling<br>
<br>
we get into a state where the stream of consciousness of our friends and followers<br>
passes right through us<br>
<br>
